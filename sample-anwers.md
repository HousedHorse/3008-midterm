1.
web based
  + more natural
  + cost effective
  + prompt users different thing
  - harder to verify demgraphics
  - learnability
lab study
  + more pure data
  + inexpensive
  - not so realistic
  - not a natural setting
  - novelty
    - wow look at this new thing
  - hawthorne
    - I'm important because I'm in a study
  - observer effect
    - I'm being watched, I'd better do well

  - more expensive and time consuming
  - possibly unethical?
crowd sourced
  + super quick and cheap
  - less engaged

2.
usability testing
- improve product
- few participants
- not replicable

research
- discover knowledge
- many participants
- replicable

3.
between-subjects
- change subjects between stages
+ no training bias
+ order of tasks doesn't matter
- more subjects
- higher chance of variability
within-subjects
- each subject does all stages
FLIP IT BOI FOR THIS ONE

4.
lab based
- lab setting
- inexpensive
- data is more pure

field based
- real life
- data is messier
- applies to real usability

5.
low fidelity
- far from the final medium
- quick
- cheap
- easily changeable
- room for more feedback
high fidelity
- closer to final product
- locks you into one idea
- users might think it's the final product
- user-driven interactions

6.
- more functionality
- more interactive
- marketing sales tool
- looks and feels like final product
- navigational scheme

7.
- earlier on in the design process

- users can't imagine it being done another way
- they think they have the full system

9.
Vertical
- go deep on a subset of features
- lose a lot of variety

Horizontal
- cover a wide set of features
- not so detailed

10.
Contrast

- draws attention
Repetition
- consistency
Alignment
- alignment groups things together
- like tabbed list
Proximity
- keep related stuff close together

Tidwell's Design Patterns
- two panel selector
  - there is one panel for selection
  - one panel for display
- center stage
  - most important part is in center
  - secondary tools clustered around
- extras on demand
  - show most important content
  - hide the rest
  - easily accessible
- multi-level undo
  - undo list
  - can go back and forward
- cascading lists
  - multiple lists left to right
  - work off each other
  - hierarchy
- responsive disclosure
  - minimal UI to guide user by
    showing more and more after each step

11.
scenario
- story about completing a task
- features
  - characters
  - motivations
  - background
  - tasks
persona
- profile of a potential user
- built with real statistics about users
- given a name, background, etc. to make it humanized

12.
- get a better idea of who your users are
- design the app for a particular UX related to users
- team can get caught up thinking they are really people
- don't get too invested in making them super idealized

13.
- character is not believable
- character is not communicated well
- no understanding of how to use
- no high-level support

14.
primary
- directly uses the application
- frequently uses

secondary
- indirectly uses
- occasionally uses

tertiary
- affected by the introduction of the product
- influences the purchase of the product

15.
- answer specific questions
- large population
- system usability metrics
- if you were going to do a
  structured interview, questionnaire is better

16.
- specific issues
- more detailed
- semi-structured provides
  - some easy to analyze data
  - AND ability to probe for detailed points of interest
