### Interaction design 


### Mental Model
  - A cognitive framework that explains someone's thought process about how something works in the real world. A gooe model will help users reason better.
  - Ease of use of the application 

### Distributed Congnition
  - Emphasizes user expertise in order to accomplish task more efficiently 
  - Power of the application 

### External Cognition
  - A cogntive framework where the emphasis is to reduce the users cognitive load. The general idea is to relieve someone of the burden 

### Cognitive Walkthrough 
 - 3 Questions 
    - Does the user know what to do ?
    - Do they see how accomplish the action?
    - Does the user know how to proceed  from the feedback given ?
  Pros:
    - Emphasizes learnability of the interface 
    - Work in a team in order to find flaws 
  Cons: 
    - Relatively time consuming as it requires a team 

### Wizard-of-oz
 - Work through the low fidelity prototype with a real users 
 - Develope an understanding of how the user feels during the application 

### Heuristic evaluation 
 - We don't have to recruit real users 
 - Heuristic evaluation can cover much more of the interface in a short time
 - Can continue if application has broken features 

### Gulf of execution 
- The gap of what to do and how to do it 

### Gulf of evaluation 
- The gap of understanding what happens 

### Traditional Models 
- Information Processing: conceptualizes human performance in metaphorical terms of information processing stages 

### GOMS
  - Goals 
    - What the users wants to achieve 
  - Operator 
    - Congnitive processes and physical actions needed to obtain goals 
  - Method 
    - Procedure to accomplish goals
  - Selection rules 
    - Decide which method to select when there is more than on 

### Conceptual Model 
  - High level description of how a system is organized and operates 

### Interface Metaphors
- Interface designed to be similar to a physical entity 
- Generate many possible metaphors 

### Interaction types 

#### Instructing 
- Issuing commands and selecting options 

#### Conversing 
- Interacting with a system as if having a conversation 

#### Manipulating 
- Intercating with objects in a virtual or physical space by manipulating them 

#### Exploring 
- Moving through a virtual or physical environment
