### Interaction design 
- Designing interactive products to support the way people communicate in their everyday and working lives 

### Advantages of involving users in the design process. 
- Get user feedback from users that actually will use your product 
- Users becomes stakeholder (Invested in the application doing well)

### Specifying usability goals and using them in testing.
- Effectiveness 
- Efficient 
- Safety 
- Utility 
- Learnability
- Memorability 
- SULEEM

### Common Design Principles 
- Feeback 
- Affordance 
- Constraint 
- Visibility 

### Questionaire 

#### Pros
- Measure system usability 
- Background requirement research 

#### Cons 
- Order of the questions matter

### Questionnaire Question Types 

#### Likert 
- Scale from strongly disagree to agree 

#### Semantic Scale 
- One side is easy to on side is hard to use 

#### Reversed Questions 
- Get rid of aquiesence bias 

### Observation 

#### Simple 
- Ask the user to do an action and observe

#### Think-Aloud 
- User goes through the task and thinks out loud 

#### Co-discovery 
- When you get to people to complete a task and they talk out loud 

### Interviews 

#### Unstructured
- Talk out loud 
- Alot of data to analyse 

#### Structured 
- Close ended 
- Planned
- Equally effective as a questionaire 

#### Semi-structure 
- Planned and has the ability to probe

### Types of user studies 

#### Lab-bases 
- Controlled in Labs 
- Controlled conditions 
- Lacks real word application

#### Field Base 
- In the real world 
- Valuable data 
- Takes a long time to conduct and parse 

#### Web based studies 
- Gather data from online sources 
- Cost effective
- More natural setting 
- May be difficult to get consent 
- More natural setting but is uncontrolled 

#### Crowd source study 
- Quickly gather large amounts of data 
- Collect data through large crowdsourcing website 

### Usability Testing 
- Improve product 
- Procedure planned 
- Results inform design 

### Usability reseach 
- Discover knowledge 
- Many participants 
- Scientific reports 

### Beteen subjects 
- Use different subjects for experiment 

### Within Subjects 
- Same subject for the experiments 

### Novelty Effects 
- This study is cool 

### Hawtthorne 
- Better perform well in this study 

### Observer expectancy effect 
- I'm being watched, I better do this right 

### Mental Model
  - A cognitive framework that explains someone's thought process about how something works in the real world. A gooe model will help users reason better.
  - Ease of use of the application 

### Distributed Congnition
  - Emphasizes user expertise in order to accomplish task more efficiently 
  - Power of the application 

### External Cognition
  - A cogntive framework where the emphasis is to reduce the users cognitive load. The general idea is to relieve someone of the burden 

### Cognitive Walkthrough 
 - 3 Questions 
    - Does the user know what to do ?
    - Do they see how accomplish the action?
    - Does the user know how to proceed  from the feedback given ?
  Pros:
    - Emphasizes learnability of the interface 
    - Work in a team in order to find flaws 
  Cons: 
    - Relatively time consuming as it requires a team 

### Wizard-of-oz
 - Work through the low fidelity prototype with a real users 
 - Develope an understanding of how the user feels during the application 

### Heuristic evaluation 
 - We don't have to recruit real users 
 - Heuristic evaluation can cover much more of the interface in a short time
 - Can continue if application has broken features 

### Gulf of execution 
- The gap of what to do and how to do it 

### Gulf of evaluation 
- The gap of understanding what happens 

### Traditional Models 
- Information Processing: conceptualizes human performance in metaphorical terms of information processing stages 

### GOMS
  - Goals 
    - What the users wants to achieve 
  - Operator 
    - Congnitive processes and physical actions needed to obtain goals 
  - Method 
    - Procedure to accomplish goals
  - Selection rules 
    - Decide which method to select when there is more than on 

### Conceptual Model 
  - High level description of how a system is organized and operates 

### Interface Metaphors
- Interface designed to be similar to a physical entity 
- Generate many possible metaphors 

### Interaction types 

#### Instructing 
- Issuing commands and selecting options 

#### Conversing 
- Interacting with a system as if having a conversation 

#### Manipulating 
- Intercating with objects in a virtual or physical space by manipulating them 

#### Exploring 
- Moving through a virtual or physical environment
