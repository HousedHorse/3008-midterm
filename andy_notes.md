### Interaction design 
- Designing interactive products to support the way people communicate in their everyday and working lives 

### Advantages of involving users in the design process. 
- Get user feedback from users that actually will use your product 
- Users becomes stakeholder (Invested in the application doing well)

### Persona 
- Is a profile created to generalize the userbase. Reflective of the stake holders. Will be humanized with details 

### Scenario 
- A story that runs through a situation where a persona is trying to achieve a goal 
- Goal oriented 

### Specifying usability goals and using them in testing.
- Effectiveness 
- Efficient 
- Safety 
- Utility 
- Learnability
- Memorability 
- ** SULEEM **


### Common Design Principles 
- Feeback 
- Affordance 
- Constraint 
- Visibility 
- ** FACV **

### Questionaire 

#### Pros
- Measure system usability 
- Background requirement research 

#### Cons 
- Order of the questions matter

### Questionnaire Question Types 

#### Likert 
- Scale from strongly disagree to agree 

#### Semantic Scale 
- One side is easy to on side is hard to use 

#### Reversed Questions 
- Get rid of aquiesence bias 

### Observation 

#### Simple 
- Ask the user to do an action and observe

#### Think-Aloud 
- User goes through the task and thinks out loud 

#### Co-discovery 
- When you get to people to complete a task and they talk out loud 

### Interviews 

#### Unstructured
- Talk out loud 
- Alot of data to analyse 

#### Structured 
- Close ended 
- Planned
- Equally effective as a questionaire 

#### Semi-structure 
- Planned and has the ability to probe

### Types of user studies 

#### Lab-bases 
- Controlled in Labs 
- Controlled conditions 
- Lacks real word application

#### Field Base 
- In the real world 
- Valuable data 
- Takes a long time to conduct and parse 

#### Web based studies 
- Gather data from online sources 
- Cost effective
- More natural setting 
- May be difficult to get consent 
- More natural setting but is uncontrolled 

#### Crowd source study 
- Quickly gather large amounts of data 
- Collect data through large crowdsourcing website 

### Usability Testing 
- Improve product 
- Procedure planned 
- Results inform design 

### Usability reseach 
- Discover knowledge 
- Many participants 
- Scientific reports 

### Beteen subjects 
- Use different subjects for experiment 

### Within Subjects 
- Same subject for the experiments 

### Novelty Effects 
- This study is cool 

### Hawtthorne 
- Better perform well in this study 

### Observer expectancy effect 
- I'm being watched, I better do this right 

### What is a prototype 
- A model of an imagined entity to help thinking about an entity 
- Prototype to show Functionality, Appearence, Specification 

### Low fidelity Prototype 
- Medium which is unlike the final medium 
- Quick and Cheap 
- More room for user imagination 
- Evulate multiple alternatives 
- Identify requirements 

### Storyboard 
- Often used with scenarios 
- A series of sketches to show how a user might progress through a task using the device 

### Wizard Of Oz
- The user imagines acting with the application and the developper is the one that responds to them with inputs instead of th computer 
- Get more knowledge on user expectations 

### Conceptual Design 
- Transform user requirements into a conceptual model

### High fidelity prototype 
- Uses material like the final product 
- Danger that user does not imagine other possibilities 
- Closer to final product 
- User driven interation
- Less willing to critique 
- Hard to throw away

### Horizontal Prototypes 
- Provide a wide array of features that are not dep 

### Vetical Prototypes 
- Provide a small set of features that are deep

### Conceptual metaphors 
- Combine familliar knowledge with new knowledge in a way that will help the user understand product 

### Grounded Theory
- Derived theory from data
- Open: Identify catgoery 
- Axial: Flesh out and link to categories 
- Selective: Find relationships in sub-categories
<!-- --->
### Model Mismatch 
  - Slow performance 
  - Errors 
  - Frustrations 

### Mental Model
  - A cognitive framework that explains someone's thought process about how something works in the real world. A gooe model will help users reason better.
  - Ease of use of the application 
 

### Distributed Congnition
  - Emphasizes user expertise in order to accomplish task more efficiently
  - Power of the application

### External Cognition
  - A cogntive framework where the emphasis is to reduce the users cognitive load. The general idea is to relieve someone of the burden


### Cognitive Walkthrough
 - 3 Questions
    - Does the user know what to do ?
    - Do they see how accomplish the action?
    - Does the user know how to proceed  from the feedback given ?
  Pros:
    - Emphasizes learnability of the interface
    - Work in a team in order to find flaws
  Cons:
    - Relatively time consuming as it requires a team

### Wizard-of-oz
 - Work through the low fidelity prototype with a real users
 - Develope an understanding of how the user feels during the application

### Heuristic evaluation
 - We don't have to recruit real users
 - Heuristic evaluation can cover much more of the interface in a short time
 - Can continue if application has broken features

### Gulf of execution
- The gap of what to do and how to do it

### Gulf of evaluation 
- The gap of understanding what happens in the system 

### Traditional Cognition Models 
- Information Processing: conceptualizes human performance in metaphorical terms of information processing stages 
- Based on modeling mental activities that happen exclusively inside the head 

 

### GOMS
  - Goals
    - What the users wants to achieve
  - Operator
    - Congnitive processes and physical actions needed to obtain goals
  - Method
    - Procedure to accomplish goals
  - Selection rules
    - Decide which method to select when there is more than on

### Conceptual Model
  - High level description of how a system is organized and operates

#### How are conceptual models formed 
- Designer mental/Conceptual model is the model of the system 
- User Model is mental model developped through interactions with the system 
- Questions asked when making mental model 
  - What will the user be doing when carrying out their task 
  - How will the system support these 
  - What kind of interface metaphor if any will be appropriate 
  - What kind of interaction modes and styles to use 
### Interface Metaphors
- Interface designed to be similar to a physical entity
- Generate many possible metaphors

### Interaction types

#### Instructing
- Issuing commands and selecting options

#### Conversing 
- Interacting with a system as if having a conversation 
- Google home 
- Misunderstanding arises when system does'nt know how to respond 
- Allows novice users to interact in a way that is familliar 
 
#### Manipulating
- Intercating with objects in a virtual or physical space by manipulating them

#### Exploring 
- Moving through a virtual or physical environment 

### CRAP
- Contrast 
- Repetition 
- Alignment 
- Proximity 

### Tidwell's Design Patterns
- two panel selector
  - there is one panel for selection
  - one panel for display
- center stage
  - most important part is in center
  - secondary tools clustered around
- extras on demand
  - show most important content
  - hide the rest
  - easily accessible
- multi-level undo
  - undo list
  - can go back and forward
- cascading lists
  - multiple lists left to right
  - work off each other
  - hierarchy
- responsive disclosure
  - minimal UI to guide user by
    showing more and more after each step

<!-- Interface Types -->
### Command Lines 
- Consist of general purpose commands 
- Used for creating batch scripts or executing repeted actions 
- Advantages: Efficient, Precise 
- Disadvantage: Steep learning curve 

### GUI (Graphic User Interface )
- Any interface that uses Graphics 

### WIMP
- Think of a windows computer 
- Introduced by the Xerox Star
  - Windows 
  - Icons 
  - Menu
  - Pointing device 

### Information Visualization 
- Computer generated interactive graphics representation of complex data 
- Applifies human cognition by visualizig the data 
- Used for enhancing discovery of data, descision making
- Scatterplots, trees, clusters 

### Haptic 
- Tactile feedback for an action
- Vibrations 
- Used to enrich user experience and nudge them into the right direction 

### Tangible 
- Sensor-based interaction with a physical objects 
- Manipulating the digital object changes the digital object 
- Nintendo wii 
- Design considerations 
  - Needs to decide on the types of coupling to use 
    - Learning -> expicit mapping 
    - Entertainment -> Implicit mapping 
  - Types of physical artifacts to use 
    - Bricks, cubes, and stickies
