# Interaction Design

- designing for a user experience

# UX

- what the user thinks/feels when using the product

# Involving Users in the Design Process (Advantages)

- make users active stakeholders
- authenticity
  - domain expertise
- pragmatics
  - manage expectations

# Specify Usability Goals and Use in Testing

- SULEEM
  - safety
  - utility
  - learnability
  - efficient
  - effective
  - memorability

# Common Design Principles

- feedback
- affordance
- constraints
- visibility

# Requirements Gathering

- establishing requirements
- designing alternatives
- prototyping
- evaluating

## Basic Principles

- early focus on users
- empirical measurement
- iteration

# Persona

- representative of stakeholders
- make believable by adding a name, background, etc.

# Scenario

- story about using a product to achieve a goal

# Data Types

- qualitative
  - description
- quantitative
  - numbers
- objective
  - facts
- subjective
  - opinions

# Data Collection Techniques

## Questionnaires

- good for determining usability and background requirements
- cheaper than interview
- can reach more people quickly
- not as in-depth as interviews

## Interviews

- structured
  - bad, use questionnaire
- unstructured
  - good but could go off the rails
  - data hard to analyze
- semi-structured
  - this is the best
  - data easy to analyze and you can probe to get specifics
  - good mix of data

## Observation

- ethnography/field study
  - natural setting
  - risk of data being corrupted
  - focus on user in real world
- simple observation
  - don't really gain any insight into what the user is thinking
- think-aloud
  - gain insight into what the user is thinking
  - can be awkward
- co-discovery
  - insight into what the user is thinking
  - talking to partner is more natural than thinking out loud
  - have to get two people
  - social anxiety

# Choosing an Evaluation

- consider
  - goals
  - evaluation questions
  - types of data needed

# Effects

- novelty
  - hey this is cool
- observer expectancy
  - I'm being watched, I better do this right
- Hawthorne
  - I'm in a study, I'm important

# Types of User Study

- lab based
  - clean data
  - inexpensive
  - controlled setting
  - hard to achieve realism
  - problem of "effects"
- field study
  - get a good picture of how users would use the system in a natural setting
  - ecologically valid
  - data might be a bit messier
  - expensive
- web based
  - inexpensive, quick, cheap
  - can prompt participants to do things at different times
  - can be a bit disengaging
  - more natural setting
  - hard to get consent
  - hard to verify data integrity, demographic info
- crowd sourced
  - very fast and very cheap
  - quickly gather large amounts of data
  - microtasks
  - no participant/researcher interaction

# Usability Testing vs Experiments

- usability test
  - fewer participants
  - not 100% replicable
  - improve products
- experiments
  - many participants
  - fully replicable
  - reported to scientific community

# Between Subjects, Within Subjects

- between subjects
  - change subjects for each task
  - need to recruit more participants
  - no ordering or training effects
  - could introduce variability
- within subjects
  - same subjects do every task
  - ordering and training effects
  - less variability
   fewer participants

# Ethics

- don't waste time
- respect privacy
- informed consent

# Low Fidelity vs High Fidelity Prototypes

- low
  - different medium than final product
  - cheaper
  - faster
  - find requirements
  - user can imagine other ways it might work
  - compare alternatives
- high
  - same medium as final product
  - slower
  - more expensive
  - user may think they have a final product
  - user driven interaction
  - user may feel locked into the one design

# Horizontal/Vertical Prototyping

- horizontal
  - lots of features, low detail
- vertical
  - few features, high detail

# Storyboards

- numbered sketches
- describe what's going on

# Wizard of Oz Technique

- participant interacts with researcher instead of real system
- good way to find problems early
- understand user expectation

# Conceptual Design

- conceptual description of the system
- what will it look like?
- what will it do?

# Metaphor

- relate system to real life
- MS Word is like a typewriter

# Qualitative Analysis

- subjective
- inductive

## Simple Qualitative Analysis

- look for patterns and themes
- categorize
- note critical incidents

## Grounded Theory

- open
  - derive categories from data
- axial
  - assign data to categories
- selective
  - assign data to subcategories and connect
